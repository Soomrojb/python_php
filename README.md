Python with PHP
================================

This is a demonstration of how Python can be executed in back-ground via PHP script and how information can move from/to both technologies.

Installation
------------

  1. Clone the Repository
  2. Install dependencies (pip install repos)

Requirements
------------

Shared hosting doesnâ€™t allow installation or execution of Python script, even if you manage to host .py file, you will end up with limited functionality because of missing libraries & limited rights. This script would work fine from an unmanaged Linux server, you will need to host one server via DigitalOcean.com or get a dedicated server otherwise.
